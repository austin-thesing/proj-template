## Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-01-22

### Disclosure

This repository is a **project template**. By itself, it does not run a service and does not collect, track, or transmit personal data.

If you deploy an application based on this template, you (the deployer) are responsible for providing an accurate privacy policy for your specific deployment, including any data collection performed by:

- the application you build,
- your hosting provider and infrastructure (for example, server access logs that may include IP address and user agent),
- analytics/telemetry, advertising, or error reporting tools you choose to enable,
- third-party APIs and services you integrate.

### Information We Collect

For this repository alone: **none**.

For deployments built from this repository: it depends on your implementation and configuration.

### How Information Is Used

If you deploy an application, you should describe how collected information is used (for example, to provide core functionality, maintain security, prevent abuse, and improve reliability).

### Sharing

This repository does not sell or share personal information. Any sharing in a deployed application depends on the third-party services you integrate.

### Data Retention

This repository does not store user data. Retention for any deployed application depends on your infrastructure and configuration.

### Changes

We may update this document as the template evolves. If you deploy an application, ensure your privacy policy stays current with your actual data practices.
