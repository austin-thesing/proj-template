# You Might Not Need an Effect

Effects sync with **external systems only** (DOM APIs, subscriptions, network).

## Don't use Effect for:
- Derived state → compute during render; `useMemo` if expensive.
- User actions → event handlers.
- State reset on prop change → use `key` or derive during render.

## Do use Effect for:
- External subscriptions, imperative DOM, timers.
