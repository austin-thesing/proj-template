# Code Standards

## Quality
- Clear, idiomatic; **strict typing**; small composable functions.
- Focused diffs; follow existing patterns; fix linter warnings.

## Safety (scale with risk)
- Handle errors, null/undefined; validate inputs.
- APIs: schema validation; Auth: guard against XSS/CSRF/injection.
