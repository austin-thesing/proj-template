# You Might Not Need an Effect

- Use effects only to sync with external systems (subscriptions, imperative DOM, timers, network).
- Derived state: compute during render; use `useMemo` if expensive.
- User actions: event handlers, not effects.
- Reset on prop change: derive during render or change `key`.
